# Dungeon Game

## Explanation

Dungeon Game is a text-based role-playing game where players navigate through different locations, engage in battles, and manage their resources made for the Free Code Camp curriculum. The game features various locations, including a town square and a store, where players can interact with their environment and make strategic decisions.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**:
   - The game begins in the "town square" location.

2. **Explore Locations**:
   - Use the available buttons to navigate to different locations:
     - **Go to Store**: Visit the store to buy health or weapons.
     - **Go to Cave**: Explore the cave (not implemented in detail).
     - **Fight Dragon**: Engage in a battle with a dragon.

3. **Buying Health and Weapons**:
   - In the store:
     - **Buy 10 Health (10 gold)**: Increases your health by 10 if you have enough gold.
     - **Buy Weapon (30 gold)**: Purchase the next weapon in the list if you have enough gold. The weapons become stronger as you progress.
     - **Go to Town Square**: Return to the town square.

4. **Battle Mechanics**:
   - When you fight a dragon or other monsters, your attack's success is determined randomly.
   - If you hit the monster, you deal damage based on your current weapon and a random factor.
   - Both you and the monster have health values, which are updated during the battle.
   - If your health drops to 0, you lose the game. If the monster's health drops to 0, you win the battle and may proceed to other challenges.

5. **Selling Weapons**:
   - You can sell weapons to gain gold.
   - Only the first weapon in your inventory is sold, and itâ€™s removed from your inventory.

Enjoy the dungeon adventure and good luck!
